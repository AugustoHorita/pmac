These are end to end system tests and require a geobrick to run against.

This is currently DLS specific because the sample IOC used is generated by builder
from lab.xml. This IOC connects to the controls lab geobrick.

To run these tests have an instance of the lab IOC running and its PVs contactable
from the machine running the tests.

The controls lab geobrick should have the standard m variable mappings and also:-
pmac/pmacApp/pmc/trajectory_scan.pmc
pmacApp/pmc/trajectory_scan_definitions.pmc
etc/lab.pmc

Run the tests from a virtual env that has installed tests/requirements.txt by
executing pytest in the root of pmac folder
.
